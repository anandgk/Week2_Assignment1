						Hello, I am a backend developer and currently learning cool awesome Web technology stack skills at Rutgers Boot Camp.  
					</p>

					<p class="longtxt">
						I currently work at RBC in Jersey City, managing number of applications for Financial Product Control and Regulatory Reporting business functions. In between project work, when time permits, I collaborate with team members from other projects within Finance IT in learning and understanding what they do and also the technologies that they use for application development. Lately I have been learning Hadoop technology stack using JAVA and Python.

						When I am not coding, I absolutely love photography and spend lot of time on it. For me, photographs are priceless, because they freeze moments in time to cherish forever. I use lot of natural light and get facinated in taking photographs of nature and buildings. When I see something beautiful and eye catching, I just cannot resist photographing it. My friends and family have sometimes called me crazy when I spend so much time perfecting a single photo shot. I am also very much interested in everything Science, Technology and Space Exploration. The very thought that there is a gigantic stretch of unexplored space beyond the limited visible sky, sparks my curiosity and I always get overwhelmed to think, what and who is out there.
